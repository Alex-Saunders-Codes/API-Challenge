# API-Challenge

Contained is an exploration of api-queries through openweathermap and google places.

WeatherPy generates a list of over 1000 cities. I use a modified package of citipy in order to reference the latitude and longitude of the city natively from the package.

VacationPy explores using the gmaps notebook package. I ran this from a jupyter notebook, and did not work on compatibility with jupyter labs.
